# yaml Front Page for Visual Studio Code Markdown Preview 

Makes yaml front matter render as a document "title" table, followed by a "document information" table. Unlike the traditional yaml header tables, the information is organized vertically to provide readable information to identify the document.

For example, this yaml at the top of the document:

![](docs/yaml.png)

is rendered as the following heading:

![](docs/example.png)


# Features 

- Adds support for rendering yaml front matter as a table in VS Code's built-in markdown preview.
